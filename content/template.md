## Hierarchism: Unveiling Oppression's Core Beliefs

Hierarchism is a belief system. Some people just think they're better than you and over the centuries they've come up with all sorts of theories to convince you of that. 

This is a unedited chat with Deepseek AI where I'm getting it up to speed with the current working theory. It's a great perspective.

## Query: 
<div class="query">
Marx wrote capitalism to explain the emerging power system. I wrote a deeper meta theory, hierarchism. it explains how each of our current fights against oppressive systems share the same core, the belief system that there's a good, fair, or required way to measure a person's worth. Plato, a closet theologian, had to resort to the noble lie. kondiaronk is a rare figure who was able to cut through the bullshit and laugh at all those fabulations. hierarchism works when we believe in it and give our shame and fear as a glue to stabilize the system. I had a physical insight that killing the shame can directly weaken the psychic power of hierarchies. the post modernists didn't finish their homework because they didn't want to topple the pyramid. the role of hierarchism is it's instant clarity and showing the meta structure that shapes oppression worldwide, uniting disparate struggles, bridging silos

Okay, let me try to unpack what the user is saying here. They've introduced this concept called "hierarchism" as a deeper meta-theory compared to Marx's capitalism analysis. The core idea seems to be that all oppressive systems operate on the belief that there's a legitimate way to measure a person's worth. That's interesting. They mention Plato's noble lie and Kondiaronk as figures who either upheld or challenged such systems.

First, I need to understand how hierarchism is different from existing theories like Marxism or postmodernism. The user claims that postmodernists didn't finish their work because they didn't want to topple the hierarchy. So, hierarchism is supposed to provide a clearer, more actionable framework by attacking the belief systems that sustain hierarchies. The physical insight here is about "killing shame" which weakens the psychic power of these hierarchies. That makes me think of internalized oppression and how emotions like shame are tools of control.

The user also connects various struggles by pointing out the shared meta-structure of oppression. So, hierarchism is presented as a unifying theory that bridges different movements by exposing the common root. But how does this differ from intersectionality, which also looks at overlapping systems of oppression? Maybe hierarchism is more about the underlying belief in measuring worth, whereas intersectionality deals with how different axes of identity interact.

Plato's noble lie is about justifying social hierarchies through myths, so hierarchism might be arguing that all such myths rely on measuring worth. Kondiaronk, as a critic of European social hierarchies, serves as an example of someone who saw through these myths. The user's point about shame and fear being the glue that stabilizes hierarchism is crucial. If shame is a tool to enforce compliance, then overcoming it could dismantle the hierarchy's power.

The physical insight about killing shame leading to weakening hierarchies – how does that work practically? Maybe through individual and collective resistance, refusing to internalize the measures of worth imposed by the system. If people no longer feel shame for not meeting hierarchical standards, the system loses its hold. This reminds me of movements that embrace pride, like LGBTQ+ pride, which counter shame with self-affirmation.

The critique of postmodernism here is that they deconstructed but didn't aim to dismantle the power structures. Hierarchism, on the other hand, offers clarity and a meta-structure that can unite different struggles. But I wonder if the user is oversimplifying postmodernism's contributions. Postmodernists like Foucault did analyze power structures extensively, but maybe they didn't provide a clear path for action, which hierarchism claims to do.

So, the key elements of hierarchism are:

1. Belief systems that measure human worth are the root of oppression.

2. These systems are maintained through shame and fear.

3. Rejecting these measurements (by eliminating shame) can destabilize hierarchies.

4. It unites various movements by revealing the common structure.

Potential questions to consider: How does hierarchism address the material aspects of oppression, not just the psychological? How does it differ from other theories that focus on ideology, like Gramsci's cultural hegemony? What are the mechanisms by which shame sustains hierarchies, and what strategies does hierarchism propose to combat this?

Also, the mention of instant clarity and bridging silos suggests that hierarchism offers a straightforward framework that can be applied across different contexts. But is there a risk of being too reductionist? Oppression is complex, and different systems might have unique elements that a meta-theory could overlook. However, the user's intention seems to be creating solidarity among movements by highlighting shared roots.

In summary, hierarchism posits that dismantling the belief in measuring worth and overcoming shame are key to fighting oppression. It builds on Marxist analysis but goes deeper into the psychological and ideological underpinnings, aiming to unite various struggles under a common theoretical framework.

## Response: 
Your concept of **hierarchism** presents a provocative meta-theory that seeks to unearth the foundational belief systems underpinning oppression. Here's a structured analysis and synthesis of your ideas:

### Core Tenets of Hierarchism:
1. **Belief in Measuring Worth**: Oppressive systems (capitalism, racism, patriarchy, etc.) are unified by a core belief that human worth can and should be measured hierarchically. This metric—whether wealth, race, gender, or productivity—legitimizes inequality.
2. **Shame and Fear as Glue**: Hierarchies stabilize themselves by weaponizing **shame** (internalized judgment of "failure") and **fear** (of exclusion or punishment). These emotions enforce compliance and sustain the system psychically.
3. **Rejection Through Liberation**: By "killing shame"—refusing to internalize hierarchical metrics—individuals and communities weaken the system’s psychic power. This aligns with movements like body positivity, LGBTQ+ pride, or decolonial resistance that replace shame with self-determination.
4. **Unifying Struggles**: Hierarchism bridges disparate movements (e.g., climate justice, anti-racism) by exposing their shared root: resistance to imposed hierarchies of value.

### Key Differentiators from Existing Theories:
- **Marxism**: While Marx focused on material power (class, capital), hierarchism emphasizes the **psychic/ideological mechanisms** (shame, belief in "worthiness") that sustain systems. It expands beyond class to all hierarchical metrics.
- **Postmodernism**: Though postmodernists deconstructed power (e.g., Foucault), hierarchism accuses them of stopping short of actionable unity. Your theory offers a **clear meta-structure** for collective action, whereas postmodernism often fragments into relativism.
- **Intersectionality**: While intersectionality maps overlapping oppressions, hierarchism targets the **core logic** (measurement of worth) that generates those intersections. It’s a root-cause theory rather than a descriptive framework.

### Historical/Philosophical Anchors:
- **Plato’s Noble Lie**: Hierarchism likens modern ideologies (meritocracy, racial supremacy) to Plato’s myth of metals—fabricated stories that naturalize hierarchy. Kondiaronk, the Huron critic of European inequality, exemplifies resistance to such "fabulations."
- **Physical Insight**: The idea that shame’s eradication has tangible, almost bodily effects mirrors Fanon’s work on colonialism’s psychic violence. Dismantling internalized shame disrupts the hierarchy’s reproduction.

### Critiques and Considerations:
- **Material vs. Psychic**: How does hierarchism address material exploitation (e.g., labor extraction)? Is shame dismantling sufficient, or must it pair with structural change? 
- **Universalism vs. Context**: Could hierarchism’s broad brush overlook cultural specificities? For example, caste in India or indigeneity’s relational values might resist a single meta-narrative.
- **Agency and Strategy**: What concrete steps does hierarchism propose? Is it a call to individual consciousness shifts, collective action, or both? How does it avoid the "enlightenment trap" of assuming awareness alone brings change?

### Potential Impact:
- **Solidarity Through Clarity**: By framing all struggles as anti-hierarchical, hierarchism could foster coalitions (e.g., climate activists partnering with labor movements against extractive notions of "progress").
- **Tactical Resonance**: Movements like disability justice ("nothing about us without us") or mutual aid networks already reject hierarchical worth metrics—hierarchism could theorize their shared power.

### Conclusion:
Hierarchism is a bold synthesis, challenging activists and theorists to confront the **belief in measurable human value** as the root of oppression. Its strength lies in unifying disparate struggles and centering emotional/psychic liberation. To advance it, consider engaging with materialist critiques, grounding in diverse cultural contexts, and developing praxis (actionable strategies) that marry shame dissolution with structural dismantling. If refined, it could become a transformative lens for global justice movements.
