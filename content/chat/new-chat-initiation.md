**Hierarchism**: A system enforcing human worth rankings via shame, fear, artificial scarcity. Core concepts:  
1. **Dualities & Anti-Dualities**:  
   - **Dualities**: Binaries (good/evil, rich/poor) create hierarchies.  
   - **Anti-Dualities**: Merged concepts (time=money, productivity=worth) naturalize ranking.  
   - *Example*: "Meritocracy" (anti-duality) justifies wealth/poverty duality.  

2. **Mechanisms of Control**:  
   - **Shame**: Internalized self-policing (e.g., poverty as "failure").  
   - **Artificial Scarcity**: Hoarding resources (housing, healthcare) to enforce dependency.  
   - **Belief Systems**: Framing hierarchy as "natural" (divine right, market "laws").  

3. **Historical Propagation**:  
   - **Ancient**: Plato’s philosopher-kings, Aristotle’s "natural slaves."  
   - **Medieval**: Divine right, feudal obligations.  
   - **Enlightenment**: "Rational" hierarchies (race science, capitalism).  
   - **Modern**: Neoliberalism, digital feudalism (algorithmic ranking).  

4. **Modern Manifestations**:  
   - **Corporate Hierarchies**: CEOs > workers, gig economy precarity.  
   - **Respectability Politics**: Marginalized groups proving "worthiness" (LGBTQ+ assimilation).  
   - **Moralized Identities**: "Good" vs. "bad" activists (purity tests).  

5. **Resistance Pitfalls**:  
   - **Co-optation**: Movements replicating hierarchies (e.g., "woke" elitism).  
   - **False Binaries**: Debates (left/right, fixed/fluid gender) reinforcing ranking logic.  

6. **Alternatives**:  
   - **Indigenous Cosmologies**: Relational ontologies (all beings as kin), cyclical time.  
   - **Mutual Aid**: Resource sharing without means-testing.  
   - **Unranked Spaces**: Communities rejecting productivity/shame metrics.  

**Key Takeaway**: Hierarchism’s power relies on conflating roles (parent, CEO) with inherent worth. Dismantling requires rejecting measurement logic and building systems prioritizing collective care over ranking.
