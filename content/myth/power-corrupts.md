## Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely

- *nobody's more at risk than someone who think they're safe*

We love to say that. Makes us feel smart. But what is power?

We get a little bit of fear thinking it's impossible to know how we would act in a situation where we have power over others. Oh but you can only hope it's unknowable!

But some artists and actors don't fall in that trap. What's known of them is their character in fact so it's quite visible. What is the difference between those who fall for it and those who retain their character?

Calling it power is a misnomer. The type of power at play here is hierarchism. Separating people between those who have value and those who don't. It must feel validating to become rich and beloved. If you made it it means the system is not totally broken. You become attached to the system. Not only that, the power players in it endoctrinate you into the feeling of superiority. 

And the system bribes you with higher and higher payout for endorsing it. 

I like to think about John Krasinski. He became famous for his relatability as Jim in the office. Everyone loves John. Then he started getting bigger and bigger roles. He started directing movies. He's somebody now, plays Jack Reacher, a real man. 

But there's something lost here. Of course he's not disgusting like some other stars. But it's almost more perverted that he's being corrupted and becoming respectable.
