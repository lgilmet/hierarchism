Hierarchism is the doctrine that presumes there must be a just way to rank people against one another. That there must be a way to fairly evaluate people's worth. lol 

This is how they thought the planets moved when theologians built the truth. Today's world will look the same when we look back in 100 years.

Shame is dead. Now let's kill it. It's not self improvement. It's terraforming.
