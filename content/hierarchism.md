Hierarchism is the doctrine that presumes there must be a just way to rank people against one another. That there must be a way to fairly evaluate people's worth. lol 

This is how they thought the planets moved when theologians built the truth. Today's world will look the same when we look back in 100 years.

*A geocentric model of our universe, from James Ferguson’s 1756 “Astronomy Explained,” highlights its absurdity; the Ptolemaic system required that the planets in our solar system orbit Earth in strange, looping arcs.*

Seeing hierarchism helps us make sense of this nonsense. 

### When we kill shame, hierarchies shake.
